# MYRO — CLAUDE.md (Cockpit)
### Session Control File · v5.0 · May 2026

---

## SESSION START RITUAL

1. Read this file top to bottom
2. State your full plan for today and wait for "yes / proceed / go ahead"
3. Work one task at a time — commit after each completed task
4. Before ending: update **Last Session Summary** below

---

## ABSOLUTE RULES

- Never merge to `main` directly — only to `Develop`. `main` = Vercel production.
- Never hardcode API keys — use `.env` files, never commit `.env`
- Never skip tests before marking a task complete
- Web only (mobile-responsive) — use tailwindcss and shadcn
- **Newsletter articles: collaborate before drafting.** Do NOT write a full newsletter article without first agreeing with Shivam on angle, dashboards/images, and heading. Two-line confirmation pass minimum. See VOICE-NOTES.md for protocol.

## PROJECT IN ONE PARAGRAPH

Myro is an Intelligence-as-a-Service platform for job seekers. User uploads CV → skills extracted + matched against global skill taxonomy (L1–L5) → top 5 job matches found by skill overlap + LLM-ranked → top 3 recommended with explanations → Myro Score (0–100) computed across 10 domains → user sees score, domain breakdown, top 3 jobs, top 5 skill upgrades. XP economy: welcome grant 1000 XP on CV upload, +50 per forge session, +30 per diary entry. Skill levels advance via forge session counts (L0→L1=3, L1→L2=9, L2→L3=27, L3→L4=108 sessions).

**Tech stack:** FastAPI (backend) · Railway (backend hosting) · Next.js 14 (frontend), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui · Supabase/PostgreSQL (DB) · Vercel (frontend hosting) · OpenRouter API (LLM ranking)

**Architecture deep-dive:** `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` (832 nodes, 1247 edges) + `graphify-out/graph.html`

---

## CODING CONVENTIONS

**Python:** 3.11+, async/await, type hints everywhere, Pydantic for validation, Supabase client for all DB ops (no SQLAlchemy/Alembic), `HTTPException` only, 100% test coverage on scoring engine.

**TypeScript:** Strict mode ON, no `any`, functional components only, all API calls via `lib/api.ts`, TanStack Query for server state, Zustand for UI-only state, 375px mobile viewport required.

**Git commits:** `feat:` `fix:` `chore:` `docs:` `test:` `refactor:` — one scope per commit.

**File size:** No file > 300 lines. Split if exceeded.

## ENVIRONMENT

- Python venv: `.venv/` (project root) — `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Install deps: `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
- Backend dev: `PYTHONPATH=backend uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
- Frontend dev: `cd frontend && npm run dev`

---

## CODEX TWO-AGENT WORKFLOW

| Task type | Best fit |
|---|---|
| Multi-file orchestration, cross-cutting refactors | Claude Code |
| Mechanical splits / renames once interfaces are agreed | Codex |
| Test scaffolding for new module boundaries | Codex |
| Single-file Python tweaks with clear instructions | Either |

**Shared:** All work on `Develop`. Run `pytest backend/tests` + `tsc --noEmit` + `next lint` before marking complete.

---

## DECISIONS LOCKED

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| OQ1 | Separate repos. Myro + firecrawl_Supabase stay independent. |
| OQ2 | Token-scoped for user endpoints. Service-role for admin/internal only. |
| OQ3 | Intentional LLM separation. Scraper = local LM Studio. Myro = cloud (OpenRouter→Groq→Gemini). |
| OQ4 | Single canonical scoring. `compute_and_persist_score()` is source of truth. |
| S3 | `job_applications.status = 'pending'` means saved/targeted. Every saved job is an intended application. |
| S4 | Intel is ephemeral. Skill targets inferred from saved jobs only. No DB writes. |
| NU1 | Profile auto-provisioned from JWT email + user_metadata.full_name on first authenticated request. Admin client (bypass RLS). |
| NU2 | `update_profile` UPSERTs (defensive). |
| XP1 | XP is permanent — never resets. Wallet the user owns forever. |
| XP7 | Cart is ephemeral Zustand state until diary submit → snapshot as `daily_logs.cart_skills JSONB`. |
| XP9 | Company tab selection reconfigures the WHOLE Mission Control page. |

---

## DB SCHEMA (key tables)

- `user_profiles`: `xp_balance INTEGER`, `welcome_xp_granted BOOLEAN`
- `daily_logs`: `cart_skills JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]'`
- `forge_sessions`: `(id, user_id, skill_name, skill_id, level_before, level_after, sessions_toward_next, duration_minutes, xp_earned, completed_at)`
- `user_skills`: `forge_sessions_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0`
- `job_skills (job_id FK→jobs, skill_id FK→skills, is_primary BOOLEAN)` — canonical skill source
- `followed_companies (user_id, company_name, UNIQUE(user_id, company_name))` — RLS-protected
- `jobs.location_country / location_city / location_mode / location_quality` — all backfilled
- `cv_history.content_hash TEXT` — SHA-256 of raw extracted text for re-upload short-circuit

**Infrastructure:**
- Railway: `True_Yodha` → `Develop` → auto-deploy
- Vercel: `truemirror.vercel.app` → `main`
- Supabase: `gipvxuugajkugntwkeiz` (prod DB)
- LLM chain: OpenRouter free llama → Groq llama-3.3-70b → Gemini flash-lite → OpenRouter paid

## OPEN BACKLOG

1. **Drop `jobs.main_skills` / `jobs.side_skills`** — confirm ≥1 full scraper run wrote to `job_skills`, then `ALTER TABLE jobs DROP COLUMN main_skills, DROP COLUMN side_skills`.
2. **Report as Inactive feature** — spec at `docs/REPORT_INACTIVE_FEATURE.md`. Needs `job_reports` table + scraper Phase 3 upload first.
3. **`user_job_matches` design review** — Shivam wants clarification + design changes to this table. Discuss before next session touching match compute or Active Focus.
4. **Intel page — job analytics loading screen** — while mySkillDemand + heatmap load, show step-by-step progress states ("loading market data → mapping your skills → building heatmap") instead of blank spinner.
5. ~~**Intel page — skill selector panel**~~ ✅ DONE 2026-05-12 — TrackedDigest replaced with SkillSelectorPanel; user-curated heatmap columns.
6. **Intel page — PR2: Run Analysis** — `POST /jobs/analyse/{job_id}` endpoint, deducts 50 XP, runs skill gap for single job, writes to `user_job_matches`. Wire "Analyse → 50 XP" button in Self Focus strip on home page.
7. **Intel page — TopMovers: all companies** — show all 145 companies in descending order (not just top 6), scrollable list, ★ follow on every row, search input. Zero new API calls (all data in `analytics.by_company`).

**Defer to v2:** domain layer separation · Rename Mirror→Myro in remaining strings · Pillar pages `/careers/*`

## LAST SESSION SUMMARY (2026-05-12)

```
Intel page — Skill Selector Panel + 4-layer perf fix (C1–C4).

Shipped to Develop:
  - Backlog #5 DONE: TrackedDigest → SkillSelectorPanel. User toggles CV skills
    as heatmap columns (max 8). Chips show L-level + 30d job count. "↗ Switch
    to my CV skills" button appears until user opts in (see C4).

  - C1 — Backend heatmap cache: _heatmap_cache dict added to
    backend/app/repositories/jobs.py. Key=(frozenset(companies), frozenset(skills)),
    TTL=7 days (_ANALYTICS_TTL). First load still 27-34s; subsequent loads ~200ms.

  - C2 — Backend search cache: _search_cache dict added to same file.
    Key=(company, skill, role_domain, location_*, page, page_size), TTL=1 day.
    Repeat drill-down clicks on same cell → instant.

  - C3 — Optimistic follow mutation: followMutation now has onMutate that
    immediately splices company into/out of queryClient cache. onError rolls back.
    Star flips instantly — no 6-29s wait.

  - C4 — Heatmap double-fire fix: introduced heatmapApplied state. Heatmap fires
    ONCE at ~750ms with global top-8 skills (stable key). mySkillDemand arriving
    at 6s no longer re-keys the query. Skill Lens shows user's CV skills; user
    clicks "↗ Switch to my CV skills" to opt in → re-keys once (then cached).

Open (next sessions):
  - Backlog #4: Intel loading screen (step-by-step progress while heatmap loads)
  - Backlog #6: PR2 — Run Analysis endpoint + XP deduction
  - Backlog #7: TopMovers — all companies, scrollable, follow from list
  - Backlog #3: user_job_matches design review (discuss with Shivam first)
```
